Gold Build 23/10/2020



Overview:

You play as a test subject in a mysterious facility.
You are stuck within a time loop.
You must use trial and error to find the right path to escape the building, before the day resets.
In order to do that, you must find clues and solve puzzles.



Controls:
- Normal FPS controls:
	- Mouse to look around.
	- WASD to walk.
	- Space to jump.
	- Left Control to crouch.
	- Escape to toggle pause menu.
- Left Mouse Button to interact.
- Right Mouse Button to drop an item from your hand.
- R to restart the level.

- Q to open notes.
- E to take screenshot.

- Scrollwheel while hovering over a vault safe number.
- Keyboard key numbers while hovering over a PIN NumPad.



Playtesting:

This build was for MDS submission, so we left in the debug playtest tools.
If this were a real release quality build, we would have removed these tools and spent about three more weeks polishing the game.

- F3 to toggle debug info for playtesting.
- K to pause/unpause the remaining steps.



Cheat Sheet for Levels:

Level 1:
- Find the whiteboard and take a screenshot by pressing E.
- Find yellow key card.
- Get past the yellow-locked door to the second room.
- Find red key card somewhere in the centre cubicles.
- Find whiteboard #2.
- Get past red-locked door to the third room.
- Find blue key card in drawers or on tables next to couches.
- Find whiteboard #3.
- Get past blue-locked door at top of stairs.
- Find whiteboard #4.

- Press R to restart the level.
- Get to the NumPad in the third room.
- In your mind combine the whiteboard clues to work out the 4 digit PIN code.
- Pick up the syringe.
- Walk to the next double doors to load the next level.

Level 2:
- Find stairs and walk up. Find restroom and read the note clue (has CONFIDENTIAL stamped on it).
- Find second half of that clue by searching the glass-wall offices in first room.
- With these two clues you can unlock the first NumPad.
- Find four trophies in the first room cubicles. Take screenshots of each trophy and its accompanying computer screen number.
- The trophy represents the position of a PIN digit, and the computer screen number represents the digit. For example, a 2nd place trophy with a circled 4 means the combination starts with '_4__'.
- With the trophy clues you can unlock the second NumPad, which starts the conveyor belts.
