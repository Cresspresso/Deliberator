Gold Build 23/10/2020



------------------- Overview -------------------

You play as a test subject in a mysterious facility.
You are stuck within a time loop.
You must use trial and error to find the right path to escape the building, before the day resets.
In order to do that, you must find clues and solve puzzles.



------------------- Controls -------------------
- Normal FPS controls:
	- Mouse to look around.
	- WASD to walk.
	- Space to jump.
	- Left Control to crouch.
	- Escape to toggle pause menu.
- Left Mouse Button to interact.
- Right Mouse Button to drop an item from your hand.
- R to restart the level.

- Q to open notes.
- E to take screenshot.

- Scrollwheel while hovering over a vault safe number.
- Keyboard key numbers while hovering over a PIN NumPad.



------------------- Playtesting -------------------

This build was for MDS submission, so we left in the debug playtest tools.
If this were a real release quality build, we would have removed these tools and spent about three more weeks polishing the game.

- F3 to toggle debug info for playtesting.
- K to pause/unpause the remaining steps.
- F6 to go into free camera mode.

You can find a level select screen by starting the game and going to "Playtest Tools" in the pause menu.



------------------- Gameplay Notes -------------------
- If you have an item in your hand, you must manually drop it to pick up something else (even a flashlight).





------------------- Cheat Sheet for Levels -------------------
Remember that it is encouraged to restart the level multiple times.



------------------- Level 1 -------------------
The final goal is to get past the NumPad.

- Find the whiteboard and take a screenshot by pressing E.
- Find yellow key card.
- Get past the yellow-locked door to the second room.
- Find red key card somewhere in the centre cubicles.
- Find whiteboard #2.
- Get past red-locked door to the third room.
- Find blue key card in drawers or on tables next to couches.
- Find whiteboard #3.
- Get past blue-locked door at top of stairs.
- Find whiteboard #4.

- Press R to restart the level.
- Get to the NumPad in the third room.
- In your mind combine the whiteboard clues to work out the 4 digit PIN code.
- Pick up the syringe.
- Walk to the next double doors to load the next level.



------------------- Level 2 -------------------
The final goal is to get past the third NumPad, at the bottom of the darkly lit room forwards from the start room (not the green one to the right).

From the cubicle offices:
- Find a stairwell and walk up.
- Find a restroom and read the note clue (has CONFIDENTIAL stamped on it).
- Find the second half of that clue by searching the glass-wall offices.
- With these two clues you can unlock the first NumPad at the top of the stairs in the darkly lit not-green room.
- Find four trophies in the first room cubicles. Take screenshots of each trophy and its accompanying computer screen number.
- The trophy represents the position of a PIN digit, and the computer screen number represents the digit. For example, a 2nd place trophy with a circled 4 means the combination starts with '_4__'.
- With the trophy clues you can unlock the second NumPad, which starts the conveyor belts.

- Restart the level.
- Find the screwdriver under a lamp in the darkly lit not-green room.
- Get past the first NumPad.
- Activate the second NumPad to start the conveyor belts.
- Use the screwdriver to enter the vent in the same room as the second NumPad.
- Go through the vents and come out in the darkly lit green room with conveyor belts.
- Find the red key card which was unpacked from a box by the machine at the end of the conveyor belts.
- Get past the red-locked door, to a room with pipes and red valves.
- Turn the valve next to the window.
- It will spray steam and reveal the final PIN for the third NumPad at the bottom of the darkly lit non-green room where the screwdriver was.

- Restart the level.
- Get past the third NumPad.
- Go to the end of the room, which will then load the next level.



------------------- Level 3 -------------------
The final goal is to get past the red-locked door.

- Find the yellow key card somewhere in the hallway.
- Find notes indicating that the NumPad has a four digit PIN where all four are the same digit.

- The safe contains a syringe and a blue key card.
- Pick up the syringe to gain more steps remaining.
- Take the yellow key card and unlock the room at the end of the hallway.
- Go back to the safe, take the blue key card and go to the room at the end of the hallway.
- Unlock the blue-locked display case which contains a red key card.
