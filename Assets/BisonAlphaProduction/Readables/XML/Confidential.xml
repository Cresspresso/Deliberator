  <text>After so many experiments, attempts and failures, the emergency antidote has finally been done, tested and made.  This is the one and only antidote that will be able to cure the supervirus and should only be use in emergencies!  I have left this emergency antidote in a safe chamber and can only be opened with a keycard locked in a vault safe.  The code is 9567.  Again, only use this when it is needed!  [CONFIDENTIAL]</text>
